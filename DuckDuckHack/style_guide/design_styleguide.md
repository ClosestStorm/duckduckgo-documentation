##Key Concepts
When designing a plugin there are a few key concepts to keep in mind:

* Continuity
* Simplicity
* Usability
* Flexibility
* Space

##Continuity
All plugins, regardless of their plugin type (Spice, Goodie, Fathead or Longtail) should maintain visual design continuty. This means that the styling and placement of the ZCI Box elements should be the same for all plugins. The following design elements should be consistant across all plugins:

### Plugin Width
The width of plugins is automatically calculated based on the users screen size and should not be modified. Individual users are able to change the width of the SERP by modifying their settings.

### Minimze Button
The minimize/maximize button should not be altered or moved.

### Borders
The borders of the Zero Click Box should not be alterted. They should remain `1px solid #c9c9c9`.

### Background colors
The background color of all plugins should match the SERP background color (#FDFDFD). 

### Font colors

### Font-family (except fixed-width for code)

### Links (#1168CE)
