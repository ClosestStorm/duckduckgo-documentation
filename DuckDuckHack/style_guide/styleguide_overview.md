#DuckDuckHack - Plugin Style Guide
At DuckDuckGo we aim to make our plugins highly informative and simple to use. This means that only the most relevant information should be included in a zero-click result and the user should be able to immediately understand what they are looking at.

We also strive to ensure all our plugins are designed and built with a focus on consistency. This means we maintain certain visual aspects across all of our plugins such as the fonts and colors used, as well as the layout and placement of common elements, like the maximize/minimize button. This helps instill a feeling of familiarity in our users when they come across new plugins and also helps reaffirm the expected results of their actions, eg. all blue, underlined text should always open a link when the user clicks it

Furthermore, as a largely open-source project, we like to keep our code as consistant as our plugins. This means all code should be formatted the same way and should look and feel as though it has all been written by the same person.
