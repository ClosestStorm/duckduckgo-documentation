# Installing DuckPAN

```bash
curl http://duckpan.org/install.pl | perl
```

[This script](https://github.com/duckduckgo/p5-duckpan-installer) will setup [local::lib](https://metacpan.org/module/local::lib), which is a way to install Perl modules without changing your base Perl installation. (If you already use local::lib or [perlbrew](https://metacpan.org/module/perlbrew), don't worry, this script will intelligently use what you already have).

If you didn't have a local::lib before running the install script, you will need to run the script twice. It should tell you when like this:

```txt
please now re-login to your user account and run it again!
```

If everything works, you should see this at the end:

```bash
EVERYTHING OK! You can now go hacking! :)
```

Note that with local::lib now installed, you can easily install [Perl modules](http://search.cpan.org/) with [cpanm](https://metacpan.org/module/cpanm).

```bash
cpanm App::DuckPAN
App::DuckPAN is up to date.
```
