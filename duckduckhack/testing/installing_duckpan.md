# DuckPAN

**The DuckDuckHack Developer Tool**

DuckPAN is an application built to aid DuckDuckHack developers. It is mainly used to generate the required files for new Instant Answers (the developer must implement functionality) and also test both the triggering and visual display of Instant Answers.

**Currently DuckPAN only supports Goodie and Spice Instant Answers.**

## Disclaimer


### Operating Systems

Currently, DuckPAN has been developed on, and works well with **Ubuntu**. More specifically, we regularly build, test and run DuckPAN on **Ubuntu 12.04**. We have also successfully installed and run DuckPAN on older and newer Ubuntu releases, e.g. Ubuntu 10.04, 12.10, and 13.04.

Developers have also been successful running DuckPAN on other Linux distros (e.g. Arch, Debian) and on Mac OS X 10.8 and later, but **we make no promises that it will work outside of Ubuntu**.

As well, **there have been reported issues with installing DuckPAN on Windows**, so we don't recommend you go down that path.

That being said, we are more than willing to help you debug any installation problems, so please come to us with your problems and we'll try to get your issues sorted out. If you'd like some help from our community, feel free to engage with them on the [DuckDuckGo forum](http://duck.co/).


### Perl Versions

We run our DuckPAN tests against Perl 5.16 and 5.18 using Travis (https://travis-ci.org/duckduckgo/p5-app-duckpan). We suggest you install Perl 5.16 via Perlbrew for local development. The Codio boxes come with Perlbrew and Perl 5.18 already installed.

## Getting Started

Getting started with DuckPAN is easy! Here's a list of ways you can get DuckPAN up & running:

- **Use our Codio Project Template ([see below](#using-the-codio-project-template))**. We highly recommended this choice! It's *super* quick and easy.
- Use our DuckDuckHack development virtual machine image ([see below](#duckduckhack-development-virtual-machine))
- Use the Vagrant virtual environment ([see below](#vagrant-virtual-environment))
- Install DuckPAN locally ([see below](#installing-duckpan-locally)). Keep in mind, this **requires Linux or Mac OS X**. We suggest you install [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download).

After installing DuckPAN, be sure to checkout the [Using DuckPAN](#using-duckpan) section below!

------


## Using the Codio Project Template

1. Create an account on [Codio](https://codio.com/).
-2. Go to https://codio.com/duckduckgo/duckduckhack and fork the project. Make sure to fork the project and the box.
-![Codio Fork](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fduckduckgo%2Fduckduckgo-documentation%2Fmaster%2Fduckpan%2Fassets%2Fcodio_fork.png&f=1)
-![Codio Fork Both](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fduckduckgo%2Fduckduckgo-documentation%2Fmaster%2Fduckpan%2Fassets%2Fcodio_fork_both.png&f=1)
-3. Visit one of our Instant Answer repositories (such as https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice), and follow GitHub's instructions to first [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the repository. You can then clone the repo into your Codio machine (You need to open the Terminal for this).
-![Codio Terminal](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fduckduckgo%2Fduckduckgo-documentation%2Fmaster%2Fduckpan%2Fassets%2Fcodio_terminal.png&f=1)
-4. Go into the directory (by typing in `cd zeroclickinfo-spice`) and run `duckpan server`. Click on "DuckPAN Server" to view the webpage.
-![Codio Server](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fduckduckgo%2Fduckduckgo-documentation%2Fmaster%2Fduckpan%2Fassets%2Fcodio_server.png&f=1)
-5. You're all set!
-![Codio Success](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fduckduckgo%2Fduckduckgo-documentation%2Fmaster%2Fduckpan%2Fassets%2Fcodio_success.png&f=1)

Try typing in queries like "define hello," and see if it works for you. You might be wondering why there are no search results in the page. It's because DuckPAN isn't configured to work with search resultsâ€”it's only for testing Instant Answers.

MD5: 6ecdeb8ead2c2eb7a9aba1db22359c4b

https://ddg-community.s3.amazonaws.com/ddh-vmw-2014-12-23.ova


#### Roadmap

- Docker support
- Public AMI for use on EC2


### Installing the Virtual Machine

To use the Virtual Machine, you will need to download and install **VirtualBox**, **VMWare Workstation** or **VMWare Player**, depending on your current OS.

Then you will need to import the VM.


#### VirtualBox (free)

Website: https://www.virtualbox.org/
Supports: Windows, OS X, Linux


##### Import the VM

1. Download the OVA
2. Open VirtualBox, click "File" and then click "Import Appliance"
3. Click "Open appliance..." and select the DuckDuckHack virtual appliance OVA file -- click "Next"
4. Click "Import"


#### VMWare Player (free)

Website: https://www.vmware.com/products/player/
Supports: Windows, Linux


##### Import the VM

1. Download the OVA
2. Open VMWare Player, and click "Open a Virtual Machine"
3. Choose a storage path for the Virtual Machine -- click "Import"


### Using the Virtual Machine


#### Logging into the VM

Once you have installed the virtual machine you should be able to start up the VM and login with the following credentials:
- **username** : `vagrant`
- **password** : `duckduckhack`


#### Cloning the repository on the VM

**The DuckPAN client has already been installed for you.** To use it, you must 1st clone your instant answer git repository.

If you haven't already done so, [Determine your Instant Answer Type](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/determine_your_instant_answer_type) and follow GitHub's instructions to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the instant answer repository.

The instant answer repositories are:
+ [zeroclickinfo-goodies](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies)
+ [zeroclickinfo-spice](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice)

Then, run the git clone command to clone the repository. The URL is the **SSH clone URL** listed on the right side of the github webpage for your forked repository. (You can also use the **HTTPS clone URL**.)

```
git clone URL
```

#### Happy Hacking!

See the instructions below on [Using DuckPAN](#using-duckpan).

## Vagrant Virtual Environment

The Vagrant-based DuckDuckHack virtual environment provides a similar sandbox to the DuckDuckHack VM, but rather than downloading a prebuilt VM, Vagrant creates an environment for you based on the defined configuration.  Vagrant is an awesome tool for building development environments.  One command - `vagrant up` - gets you a complete working environment in minutes.  Something go wrong with the environment?  No messing around with snapshots.  Tear the VM down and build a fresh environment.  The DuckDuckHack Vagrant environment uses Chef cookbooks and the DuckPAN installer script, so configuration is transparent and easily shared.

Through the Vagrant configuration, you can easily switch back and forth between a headless-mode and the traditional VirtualBox interface.  The configuration defaults to headless.


### Setup Instructions

Refer to [the duckpan-vagrant readme](https://github.com/shedd/duckpan-vagrant#installation) for installation instructions.

Once the environment has been built, **the DuckPAN client is installed and ready to go.** You can now clone the Instant Answer repos and start developing/testing.

If you run into any issues, please file an issue in the [duckpan-vagrant issue page](https://github.com/shedd/duckpan-vagrant/issues).


##### Quick Overview of key Vagrant CLI commands

There are a couple of key Vagrant commands that you'll use to manage your environment.

```
$ vagrant

up       - Build environment from Vagrantfile or resume a previously halted environment.
ssh      - Connect to your running VM via SSH.
suspend  - Pause the VM, storing its current state to disk.
resume   - Bring a suspended VM back to life.
reload   - The equivalent of running a halt followed by an up.  Use this when you make changes to Vagrantfile.
halt     - Shut down the VM. Tries to gracefully shutdown first; if that fails, it will forcefully shut the VM down.
destroy  - Stop the currently running VM and blow everything away.
```

Run these commands from the directory containing your `Vagrantfile`.

For more information, please see the (excellent) [Vagrant docs](http://docs.vagrantup.com/).

## Installing DuckPAN Locally

**Note**: You don't need to install DuckPAN locally if you're using our DuckDuckHack virtual machine or the Vagrant virtual environment. It's already installed for you!

To install DuckPAN, open your terminal and run:

```
curl http://duckpan.org/install.pl | perl
```

[This script](https://github.com/duckduckgo/p5-duckpan-installer) will setup [local::lib](https://metacpan.org/module/local::lib), which is a way to install Perl modules without changing your base Perl installation. If you already use `local::lib` or [perlbrew](https://metacpan.org/module/perlbrew), don't worry, this script will intelligently use what you already have.

If you didn't have a `local::lib` before running the install script, you will need to run the script twice. It should tell you when like this:

```
please now re-login to your user account and run it again!
```

If everything works, you should see this at the end:

```
EVERYTHING OK! You can now go hacking! :)
```

Note that with `local::lib` now installed, you can easily install [Perl modules](http://search.cpan.org/) with [cpanm](https://metacpan.org/module/cpanm).

```
cpanm App::DuckPAN
App::DuckPAN is up to date.
```


### Adding Shell Completion

Some of our awesome community members have written shell completion scripts for DuckPAN, which should save you tons of time. Feel free to improve these, or contribute new ones!


#### Bash

#### Z Shell

- Submitted by: [elebow](https://github.com/elebow)
- link: https://github.com/elebow/duckpan-completion


### Dealing With Installation Issues

If during the course of your DuckPAN install you run into errors, don't panic, there are a few things you can try.

First, try running the install command again (`curl http://duckpan.org/install.pl | perl`), this often solves issues related to any dependencies.

If that doesn't work, you should investigate the build.log and see what's wrong. It might be a dependency issue which you can resolve by manually installing whichever dependency is missing via `cpanm`.

If it still won't install with `cpanm` try adding `--notest` to the cpanm command:

```
cpanm Test::More --notest
```

If that still doesn't work, you can also try using `--force`:

```
cpanm Test::More --force
```

If this ***still*** doesn't work, please create a GitHub Issue in the DuckPAN Repo [here](https://github.com/duckduckgo/p5-app-duckpan/issues). Be sure to paste the contents of your `build.log` and also let us know the details of your OS (`$ uname -a` is great). Once you've made the issue, we'll work with you to try and solve any problems you're having.
