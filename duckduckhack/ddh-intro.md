# Give back with DuckDuckHack and help create a better search experience for everyone!

At DuckDuckGo, our users believe in more answers with fewer clicks. Why show a page full of links, when you can show an instant answer?!

DuckDuckHack is our way of letting users improve the search experience by creating useful "instant answers" so searches like, ["what is the height of the eiffel tower"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=what+is+the+height+of+the+eiffel+tower) will show you that it's exactly 1063 feet tall, or searches like, ["currently in theaters"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=currently+in+theaters) will show you what's actually playing in nearby movie theaters.

Anyone in the world can suggest or develop an, "instant answer." They're shown at the top of our results page and often provide the answer you're looking for, without even having to click!

This is what an instant answer looks like:

## Getting Involved
Whether you can code or not, there are many ways you can contribute to DuckDuckGo:

### Join our Community (of awesome people)
- **Suggest ideas for instant answers**  
  For example, rather than clicking on Rotten Tomatoes links for movie searches, DuckDuckGo users created the Rotten Tomatoes instant answer so now [movie searches](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=the+dark+knight+movie) automatically display information from Rotten Tomatoes. What do you think should be an instant answer? For some inspiration, check out the [current ideas](http://ideas.duckduckhack.com/) and the [live instant answers](https://duckduckgo.com/goodies). 

- **Discuss instant answers with others**  
  Our community thrives on discussion (and debate). We'd love for you to lend your voice to our community so that we can improve DuckDuckGo according to everyone's interests. Join the community and jump in the conversations at [our forum](https://dukgo.com/ideas)

- **Propose source suggestions**  
  Everyone has a favorite source for information. Our users decided that Last.fm was a great source for music so they suggested it be used for [album searches](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Dookie+album+by+greenday)! Not every idea is submitted with a source in mind. This is where you come in! Help find the best sources for each instant answer idea (like IMDB for ideas around movie information or Yelp for ideas about local restaurants)
