# Determine Your Instant Answer Type

## Choose a Topic

Before you begin building anything, you'll need to know what instant answer it is that you want to provide. If you don't have any ideas, feel free to borrow one from our [ideas forum](http://ideas.duckduckhack.com/).

## Determine Data Source

Now that you know which queries you'd like to show an instant answer for, you'll need to find a source for your data. It could be anything such as functions you write, a large dataset or even an API.

Using this flowchart should help you to determine which kind of instant answer you'll be creating:

If the right instant answer type is still not obvious, please <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo#can-you-help-me">ask us</a>. Sometimes, multiple instant answer types can work (depending on the datasource), and we can help you figure out which one would work best.

## Fork the Instant Answer Repository

Now that you know which instant answer type you'll be using for your instant answer, you'll have to fork the associated DuckDuckHack  the repositoryinstant answer repository ([GitHub instructions](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/)) so you can start coding. If you don't already have a GitHub account, please [signup](https://github.com/signup/free) now. This is required because we use GitHub to handle all incoming *Pull Requests* (code modifications) and *Issues* (bug reports) which cannot be made without a GitHub account.

Once you have an account, please fork the appropriate repository:
