# DuckDuckHack: Toward Better Instant Answers!

DuckDuckGo users believe in better answers with fewer clicks. After all, why sift through a page full of links, when an answer is readily available?

On DuckDuckGo, these kind of instant answers are right at the top of our results page; often providing exactly what you want without an extra click!

Anyone in the world can help improve the search experience for everyone on DuckDuckGo through our DuckDuckHack program. Whether by recommending improved sources for your favorite searches, suggesting all-new classes of instant answers, or actually hacking away on the code which powers DuckDuckGo, your contribution will help improve the search experience for users around the world.

In the example shown above, our community recommended Quixey as the source for searching mobile apps. Now, any time someone searches for apps on DuckDuckGo, the Quixey results are right there with no additional effort.

## Getting Involved

We believe that it is possible for anyone, anywhere to contribute to making DuckDuckGo a better search engine. Here are some of the most popular ways people just like you contribute:

1. **Proposing Sources**

  Everyone has a favorite source for useful information (maybe it's IMDB for movies or Yelp for local restaurant information). Our users concluded that Last.fm was a great source for answers about music. Now it is used for [album searches](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Dookie+album+by+greenday) on DuckDuckGo!

  Since not every idea comes with the best possible source in mind, you can help us determine the right place to find relevant answers. Simply leave a comment with your own source suggestion.

2. **Suggesting Instant Answer Ideas**

  On DuckDuckGo, searches like ["what is the height of the eiffel tower"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=what+is+the+height+of+the+eiffel+tower) will show you that it's exactly 1063 feet tall, while ["currently in theaters"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=currently+in+theaters) will show you what's actually playing in nearby movie theaters.  We depend on suggestions from users like yourself to know what sort of useful instant answers you want from your search engine.

3. **Creating and Improving Instant Answers**

  Instant Answers depend on awesome open source developers to both create and improve them. If you're a developer and you'd like to create a new instant answer (or improve [current ones](https://duckduckgo.com/goodies)), we welcome your contributions!
