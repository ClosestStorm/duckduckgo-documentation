# Thanks for joining DuckDuckHack!

We are a community of developers and non-developers alike, with a passion for search and privacy, who are helping to make DuckDuckGo and its community a better place. As a developer, we need your help creating and improving the coolest part of our search engine - our Instant Answers!

## What are Instant Answers?


DuckDuckGo users believe in better answers with fewer clicks. Our Instant Answers are always placed at the top of the results page to provide exactly what you want, often without requiring any extra clicks.

In the above example, Quixey was a source that our own DuckDuckHack Community suggested for mobile app search. Now, any time someone searches for apps on DuckDuckGo, we can show the Quixey App Search Instant Answer!

## Get Your Hands Dirty

If you're new to programming, or you still unsure about what's involved in developing an Instant Answer, we've got the perfect thing for you!

Our [Goodie Quickstart](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-documentation/blob/master/duckduckhack/goodie/goodie_quickstart.md) will guide you through the setup process, and help you make a simple Instant Answer that will go live on DuckDuckGo.com! 

If you're confident that you can figure things out along the way, you're welcome to carry on, but we suggest that everyone look over the Quick Start anyway. If you'd like an overview of what building an Instant Answer is like, check out [this post by YouriAckx](http://blog.ackx.net/duckduckhack-accepted.html). 

## Creating Your Own Instant Answer

If you're ready to create your own Instant Answer, you'll need to know what Instant Answer you want to provide. Will it perform a calculation? or maybe, provide real-time information about an event? There are many possibilities for what you can do, but your Instant Answer should always provide more value than any regular search result links, and it should use the best data source possible.

If you're at a loss for ideas, our Community has submitted and voted on hundreds of [their own ideas](https://duck.co/ideas) that you can to bring to life!

Once you know the Instant Answer you'd like to provide, you'll need to [determine your Instant Answer type](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-documentation/blob/master/duckduckhack/getting-started/determine_your_instant_answer_type.md).
