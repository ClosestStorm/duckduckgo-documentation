# DuckDuckHack: Creating Instant Answers!

At DuckDuckGo, our users believe in more answers with fewer clicks. Why show a page full of links, when you can show an instant answer?!

DuckDuckHack is a way for anyone to improve the search experience on DuckDuckGo.com, by creating useful "instant answers" so that searches like, ["what is the height of the eiffel tower"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=what+is+the+height+of+the+eiffel+tower) will show you that it's exactly 1063 feet tall, or searches like, ["currently in theaters"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=currently+in+theaters) will show you what's actually playing in nearby movie theaters.

Anyone in the world can suggest or develop an, "instant answer." They're shown at the top of our results page and often provide exactly what you're looking for, without even having to click!

This is what an instant answer looks like:

In the above example, Quixey was a source recommended by our community for searching mobile apps. Now, any time someone searches for apps on DuckDuckGo, we can show the Quixey results as an instant answer!

###For Everyone:

1. **Suggest and Discuss Instant Answer Ideas:**
  
  For example, DuckDuckGo users suggested and debated what should go into the Rotten Tomatoes instant answer. Now, [movie searches](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=the+dark+knight+movie) automatically display the most useful information from Rotten Tomatoes. _(For some inspiration, check out the [current ideas](https://dukgo.com/ideas) and the [live instant answers](https://duckduckgo.com/goodies))._

2. **Propose Source Suggestions:**
  
  Everyone has a favorite source for information (like IMDB for movies or Yelp for local restaurant information). Our users decided that Last.fm was a great source for music so they suggested it be used for [album searches](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Dookie+album+by+greenday)! Not every idea is submitted with a source in mind, though. This is where you come in! Help determine the best sources for each instant answer idea by leaving a comment on current ideas with your source suggestion.

###For Developers:

1. **Create and Improve Instant Answers!:**

  Instant Answers depend on awesome open source developers for creation and improvements. If you're a developer and you'd like to create a new instant answer (or improve [current ones](https://duckduckgo.com/goodies)), we'd love your involvement!
