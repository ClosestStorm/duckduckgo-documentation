# Thanks for joining DuckDuckHack!

We are a community of developers and non-developers alike, with a passion for search and privacy, who are helping to make DuckDuckGo and its community a better place. As a developer, we need your help creating and improving the coolest part of our search engine - our Instant Answers!

## What are Instant Answers?

DuckDuckGo users believe in better answers with fewer clicks. Our Instant Answers are always placed at the top of the results page to provide exactly what you want, often without requiring any extra clicks.

In the above example, Quixey was a source that our own DuckDuckHack Community suggested for mobile app search. Now, any time someone searches for apps on DuckDuckGo, we can show the App Search Instant Answer!

## Creating Your First Instant Answer

First, you'll need to know what Instant Answer you want to provide. Will it perform a calculation? or maybe, provide real-time information about a flight? There's many possibilities for what you can do, but your Instant Answer should always provide more value than any regular search result links, and it should use the best data source possible.

If you're at a loss for ideas, our Community has submitted and voted on hundreds of [their own ideas](https://duck.co/ideas) that you can to bring to life!

Once you know the Instant Answer you'd like to provide, you'll need to [determine your Instant Answer type](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/determine_your_instant_answer_type).
