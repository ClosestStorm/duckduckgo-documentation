# Preparing for Pull Request

By now you should have:

- Determined your plugin type
- Fork3ed the correct repository
- Wrote the code for your plugin
- Wrote a test for your plugin
- Verified that everything works and nothing is broken

At this point you are ready to add metadata to your plugin, so we can showcase your plugin on the [Goodies page](https://duckduckgo.com/goodies).

The next section will explain the metadata.
