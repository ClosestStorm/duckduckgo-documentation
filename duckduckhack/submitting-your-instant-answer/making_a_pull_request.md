# Making a Pull Request

Now that you've gone over the [developer checklist](https://dukgo.com/duckduckhack/developer_checklist) and added [Metadata](https://dukgo.com/duckduckhack/metadata) to your instant answer, you're ready to submit a pull request.

If you're unsure how to create a pull request, GitHub provides excellent [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

The root of each repository contains a `pull_request_template` which includes the most common questions the team will have about your contribution. Using this template will help speed review of your pull request. The contents of this file can be copied and pasted directly into the pull request description.
